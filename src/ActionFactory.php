 * Action Factory
 * Theoretically, this factory would create an action list from pulling
 * data from different respositories, using a read model from CQRS.
 * I could imagine pulling from different apps (delivery, rideshare, renting, etc),
 * or from APIS or from a DB directly.  In this case, I used .json text files
 * to store the data to act as a stub.
 * 
 * Both additions / actions of work "delivery", "rideshare", etc
 * AND Cash-Outs are in the lists.  So in the case of matt and luke, they've taken
 * some money out already.
